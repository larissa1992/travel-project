                        <h3>Transylvania is best known as the mysterious land of bloodthirsty vampires and howling
                            wolves. Some may think it’s
                            fictional, but this central Romanian region is a real place. And it’s pretty special, too.
                            Bordered to the east by the Carpathian Mountains, ‘the land beyond the forest’ still feels
                            undiscovered. So, pack your
                            garlic – here’s the lowdown on one of Eastern Europe’s most captivating regions.

                        <h2>Clay Castle</h2>
                        <p> Straight out of a fairy tale, in the heart of Romania, in the Carpathian mountain range, in
                            Transylvania, hides a
                            strange castle.

                            Want to have a hobbit experience? Visit the fairy castle whose exact name is Castelul de lut
                            from the valley of the fairies.



                            Nestled at the bottom of the imposing Fagaras Mountains, the highest mountains of the
                            Southern Carpathians, this castle
                            stands out with its wave-shaped spruce roofs and organic curves, perfectly integrated into
                            the landscape.

                        <p>One of Romania’s amazing natural wonders, Bâlea Lake is a spectacular, must-see landmark. The
                            glacier lake has been
                            carved 2,034 metres (6,673 feet) up into the rugged stones of the Făgăraș Mountains, named
                            the ‘Transylvanian Alps’ by
                            the French geographer Emmanuel de Martonne..</p>

                            Stelvio, this is the best road
                            in the world!" Jeremy Clarkson - Top Gear. This amazing road called the Transfagarasan
                            highway passes over the Fagaras
                            mountains in Transylvania, Romania at 2000 metres. It was on this road with endless curves
                            and sheer drops that I
                            decided to invite Jeremy Clarkson and the Top Gear team to Romania. Although I never
                            received a reply to my email, I was
                            happy to see that they turned up a year later to film and experience one of the most
                            exciting and inspirational drives
                            in the world!</p>

                        <p>The Retezat Mountains are very popular with hikers, climbers and nature lovers because of the
                            varied flora and fauna,
                            rugged cliffs, waterfalls, gorges and over 50 mountain lakes, most of which are of glacial
                            origin. Most of the massif is
                            considered a protected area and is part of the Retezat National Park. The Retezat Massif is
                            home to wild animals such as
                            wolves and black goats, as well as a small number of brown bears.</p>
